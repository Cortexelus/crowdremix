I have created the most powerful granular synthesizer / crowd-source remix engine known to man. 

Start with any song ever. Local music and your friends music is preferable, because popular music is an echo chamber; music is popular because it's popular. 

It creates a SOUND PALETTE of the song!!: 
  - Segmentation. 
  - Feature Extraction. 
  - Traveling Summer Algorithm (salesman suck)
  - Finds short hamiltonian path in 27-dimensional feature space. 
  - Flatten path.

Now build rhythms with colors.
  - Euclidean rhythms
  - They sound really good

Jam with your keyboard. 
  - Press key and save loop.
  - Recall with same key.  

Crowd Source
  - Best loops saved to database
  - Build composition (either machine! or human! or little bit of both!)

Now I can finally fulfill my dream of collaborating with EVERYONE I meet.

Imagine combining this a body-controlled MIDI interface? Fuck being on stage, be in the audience and make music by dancing!

Combining the internet world of crowd source remix, with local music collaboration, with audience-immersive performance -- the ultimate in bringing the world together with music.
